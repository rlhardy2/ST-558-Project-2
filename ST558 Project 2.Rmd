# Introduction

Our goal with this project is to create a vignette about contacting an API using functions we’ve created to query, parse, and return well-structured data. We’ll then use our functions to obtain data from the API and do some exploratory data analysis. 

# Required packages

To use the functions for interacting with the API, the following packages are used:

* `tidyverse`: Tons of useful features for data manipulation and visualization
* `jsonlite`: API interaction
* `knitr`: Displaying tables in a markdown-friendly way

# Writing the Functions

Here we will write the functions for data retrieval.


# Data Retreival and Parsing

Here we will use the functions from the previous section to get our data.


# Exploratory Data Analysis
