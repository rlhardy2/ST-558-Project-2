# Introduction

Our goal with this project is to create a vignette about contacting an API using functions we’ve created to query, parse, and return well-structured data. We’ll then use our functions to obtain data from the API and do some exploratory data analysis. 

# Required packages



# Data Retreival and Parsing



# Exploratory Data Analysis
